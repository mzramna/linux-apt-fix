# linux-apt-fix
first of all this is not one of my codes, this has been taken from :
https://askubuntu.com/questions/674976/check-for-and-remove-unused-ppas

accord to the creator the usage is this:

"
Make the script executable

chmod +x ~/bin/checkPPAs

And run it with

~/bin/checkPPAs

to list all repositories and the number of installed packages.

Start the script with

~/bin/checkPPAs --delete

to remove the list files.
"

the script works better than mostly of other tools to this same work
it automaticaly removes all ppa that has no package installed from

# linux-apt-fix
